# This is the configuration file for the PvP-Bots of Bolt. There's a lot of things to configure along
# with the knockback profiles specifically made for the bots. The default config contains four bot presets
# that have pre-defined combat settings which will be perfectly fine if you use them as is. As always if you
# need any help, feel free to contact customer support at https://dsc.gg/refine

BOT-SETTINGS:
  
  # Should the bots be enabled at all?
  ENABLED: true
  
  # This essentially makes the bot w-tap before potting. Use this if your potion settings in spigot
  # are configured to have fast-potions and only work when they w-tap, otherwise bot will keep potting and not fight.
  FAST-POTS: false
  
  # Use an alternative tick factor which makes the hit delay a bit higher than the normal one.
  # This may or may not improve knockback and over experience of bot pvp depending on knockback settings.
  ALTERNATE-HIT-FACTOR: false
  
  # Should we reduce the bot's attack range when it's getting comboed for more smoother combos.
  REDUCE-RANGE-ON-COMBO: true
  
  # This will disable bolt's bot knockback system and use spigot's knockback system instead.
  # It is recommended to only enable this if you know the spigot will support Citizens NPC knockback.
  # If the spigot uses a kohi-based knockback system or mSpigot based knockback system, then it's likely it will.
  SPIGOT-BASED-KB: false
  
  # This is the movement speed for normal non-tryhard bots.
  NORMAL-MOVEMENT-SPEED: 1.0
  
  # This is the movement speed for tryhard bots.
  TRY-HARD-MOVEMENT-SPEED: 1.15
  
  # This is the movement speed for that is applied when bot has a speed potion effect.
  SPEED-EFFECT-MOVEMENT-SPEED: 1.29
  
  # Bot modes are essentially pre-determined logic related to the kit for the bot.
  # For example, Speed PvP mode would be catering to Speed kits like NoDebuff, Debuff etc.
  # Meanwhile, UHC mode would be catering to BuildUHC or SG type of kits. (Keep in mind, Bot cannot build right now)
  MODES:
    # This is the default bot-mode, which has no logic pre-determined.
    # Kits like Sumo which do not have any logic except just knocking the player off the platform are applicable here.

# Bolt randomly picks a name from this list, although if you want to enforce only one name
# then just put one single name here. Note that putting any color codes here won't work, that's in the Bot-Prefix
